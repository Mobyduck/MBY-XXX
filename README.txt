MBY-XXX

This is a simple Discord bot made with Python which is still a work in progress. Its main function is to retrieve useful information about items from the Guild Wars 2 game to the users. It does that by interfacing with the v2 API of the game and going through all the relevant stuff.

It comes with an "update.py", which goes over all the item and skill IDs of the game and saves them to a dictionary (using the format {'ID': 'name'}). It should be run for first time before starting the bot and again whenever the game updates.
